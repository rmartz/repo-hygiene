# The OKF documentation format

Everything under `docs/` follows Google's **Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** — a
convention for knowledge pages that are equally legible to humans and to agents:
a markdown file whose body is prose and whose leading YAML frontmatter carries
structured metadata, with pages linked to one another by ordinary markdown
links. The frontmatter is what lets an agent filter and rank pages by `type` /
`tags` and traverse the link graph without a translation layer.

## Content pages

Every page that documents a piece of this repo is a "content page" and carries
frontmatter delimited by `---` fences at the very top of the file:

```yaml
---
type: Library # required
title: repo-hygiene checks # required here
description: One specific sentence — the search surface an agent matches on. # required here
resource: src/index.ts # required for every non-Design type; a repo-relative path that exists
tags: [hygiene, ci, checks] # optional
---
```

This repo runs the **code-documentation flavour** of the `okf` check (the same
one `ai-tools` uses), so it is stricter than the open OKF spec in two ways:

- **`type`** is required and constrained to a curated vocabulary — **`Skill`**,
  **`Script`**, **`Library`**, **`Design`**, plus **`Reference`** for concept /
  guide pages like this one. (The upstream spec leaves `type` open; we narrow it
  because every page here documents code or a convention, not an arbitrary
  concept.)
- **`resource`** — a repo-relative path that must **exist on disk** — is
  **required on every non-`Design`, non-`Reference` page**, binding each doc to
  the code it describes. `Design` and `Reference` pages are exempt (they document
  an intent or a convention, not one source file).
- **`title`** and **`description`** are required. `description` is one specific
  sentence — it is the primary text an agent matches a query against.

The curated `type` vocabulary and the resource-exempt types are configured in
[`.repo-hygiene.yml`](../.repo-hygiene.yml) under `checks.okf`; adjust them there
if the repo grows a new kind of page.

### Optional field families

The spec defines optional **lifecycle**, **trust**, and **provenance** field
families (`status`, `stale_after`, `generated`, `verified`, `sources`,
`usage_window`, `executor`, `attester`). None are required, but when present they
are validated against the spec — for example `status` is one of `draft`,
`stable`, or `deprecated`, and every timestamp is ISO-8601 with an explicit
offset (`2026-06-30T14:00:00Z`). Unknown keys are always tolerated: a consumer
must never reject a page for a field it does not recognize.

## Index pages

Each directory in the bundle carries an **`index.md`** that links its content
pages and its sub-directory indexes. Per the spec, `index.md` files carry **no
frontmatter**, with one exception: the bundle-root [`docs/index.md`](index.md)
may carry a single `okf_version` key and nothing else.

The tree must be fully navigable — every content page is linked from its own
directory's `index.md`, and every sub-directory's `index.md` from its parent's —
so any page is reachable by following links from `docs/index.md` down. Both
conventions are enforced by the `okf-index` check.

## Enforcement

Conformance is gated by this repo's **Self-hygiene** CI job, which runs the
`okf` (frontmatter) and `okf-index` (navigability) checks from
[`@rmartz/repo-hygiene`](repo-hygiene.md) against our own `docs/` tree. Run the
same checks locally:

```bash
ai-repo-hygiene okf okf-index --check --config .repo-hygiene.yml
```
